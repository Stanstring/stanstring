Hi,I'm SXqwq in China.

I'm an OIer and I'm preparing NOIP2024,also known as National Olympaid in Informatics.

I have almost no knowledge of project development, but I will continue to learn.But now is not the time, as I am a Chinese high school student, I should first strive to learn cultural knowledge in order to get into a good university.

Nice to meet you!
